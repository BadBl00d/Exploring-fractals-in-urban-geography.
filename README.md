# Exploring-fractals-in-urban-geography.

## TIPE : This is the project I presented for the competitions at the French engineering schools called 'TIPE' during my second year of higher education. The theme for the year was the city. In this context, I aimed to delve into the exploration of applying fractals in modeling cities and understanding their practical implications for urban planning. Enjoy reading !
